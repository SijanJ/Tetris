# Tetris Game in C++ using SDL
Welcome to the Tetris Game in C++ using SDL project! This repository contains the source code 
and assets for a Tetris game implemented in C++ using the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer). The 
tetris game features both single player and two player modes. It was developed as a part of our
campus project on Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

# Requirements
Before you can enjoy the world of Tetris, you'll need the following:

C++ Compiler: You need a C++ compiler to build the game. We recommend using a C++ development environment like Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or Xcode.

SDL Library: This project relies on the SDL library (version 2.0) for graphics and input handling. You'll need to install SDL to build and run the game. Instructions for installation can be found in the 
[SDL documentation](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation).

# Building and Running
To build and run the Tetris game, follow these steps:

1.**Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine  
2.**Build the Game**: Open the project in your chosen C++ development environment (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio) and build it, ensuring that the SDL library is linked correctly.  
3.**Run the Game**: Once built successfully, run the game executable to start playing.
